## Elytra Swap
[![Donwloads](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/full_353164_donwloads.svg) ![Available for](https://cf.way2muchnoise.eu/versions/353164.svg)](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/elytra-swap)

_Elytra Swap_ not only automatically switches chestplate with elytra when falling and landing, but also lets you easily take off by just clicking with firework in air. 

Main features are:
* When you start to fall and have elytra inside your inventory, it will automatically be put into its slot and switched back with chestplate upon landing.
* If you have an elytra anywhere in your inventory and you click in the air with firework in your hand then you get kicked high into air.
* Items can be taken form and put into shulker boxes.
* You can enable and disable all of this using keybing (default: p), but for that mod needs to be installed on the client.
* To allow for swapping elytra and taking off with firework this mod only needs to be installed on server. If mod is not installed on client game, then only way to disable or enable mod's functionality is by a command:  `/swap true` to enable, `/swap false`  to disable.
