Elytra Swap is a server-side, Fabric-only mod, that does a lot of things:
 * When you start to fall, it automatically replaces your chestplate with elytra (if you have one inside you inventory) and back upon landing.
 * This mod will look through your whole inventory and shulkers for those items.
 * You can set which items should be used first using a command.
 * When you click with a firework rocket in your hand, you will be propelled up in the air. (Similar to [Easy Elytra Takeoff by Serilum](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/easy-elytra-takeoff))
 * If client also has the mod installed, then you can use a keybind in order to enable and disable automatic swapping and firework takeoff.
