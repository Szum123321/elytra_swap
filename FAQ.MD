* *Why can't you make the swapping part be just client-side?*
  - The reason is simple, I don't feel like that would be fair to use on servers that do not have such mod. 
    Imagine having a fight and your oponent jumps off some cliff and then strikes from the air, 
    while you try to find your elytra and in the process you're much more vurnable that he/she is.
* *Could you port this mod to forge?*   
  - No, I own't, because I just don't like forge. You can always port this mod and even reuse my code, but I will not do that.
